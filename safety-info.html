            <h4>Avalanche Risk is Real and Often Avoidable</h4>
            <p class="p2">
              Most avalanches are triggered by the victim or their group. Always check the avalanche bulletin before
              heading out, avoid steep, open slopes after recent snowfall, and stick to marked terrain when possible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Bring the Right Safety Gear</h4>
            <p class="p2">
              If you’re heading into avalanche-prone areas, carry a beacon, probe, and shovel — and know how to use
              them. In cold conditions, a compact emergency bivy or foil blanket can prevent deadly exposure.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Hypothermia Can Set In Quickly</h4>
            <p class="p2">
              Even in mild weather, exposure to wind, wet clothing, and cold temperatures can lead to hypothermia. Wear
              moisture-wicking base layers, waterproof outerwear, and always pack dry backup clothing.
            </p>

            <h4>Recognize the Early Signs</h4>
            <p class="p2">
              Shivering, slowed movement, confusion, and slurred speech are early signs of hypothermia. Act fast — get
              the person dry, warm, and sheltered before symptoms worsen.

      <h2>Avalanche Safety</h2>

      <p>
        Avalanches are one of the most dangerous risks in mountainous terrain, especially after fresh snowfall or rapid
        temperature changes. At Kalmont Mountain, we urge all visitors to be informed, cautious, and properly equipped
        before heading into backcountry or off-trail zones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avalanches can be triggered by weather conditions, terrain, or even a single step. They often occur on slopes
        between 30° and 45° and can happen with little to no warning. Before any trip, always check the avalanche
        bulletin for current danger levels and avoid traveling alone in risky areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Travel with a group that is trained in avalanche safety, and make sure everyone carries a beacon, shovel, and
        probe — and knows how to use them. Avoid steep, open terrain after heavy snowfall, and watch for red flags such
        as recent slides, cracking snow, or “whumphing” sounds underfoot.

          <p class="p2">
            Yes. Stick to low-angle terrain, avoid traveling under cornices or across steep open slopes, and travel one
            at a time in exposed areas. Proper planning and risk assessment are key to preventing accidents.

    <section class="hypothermia-safety">
      <h2>Hypothermia Safety</h2>

      <p>
        Hypothermia is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body loses heat faster
        than it can produce it. It can happen even in above-freezing temperatures, especially when clothing is wet or
        wind is strong. On Kalmont Mountain, changing weather and high altitudes can increase the risk — fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early signs include intense shivering, numbness, confusion, and slurred speech. If not treated, hypothermia can
        progress to loss of coordination, slowed heart rate, and unconsciousness. It’s essential to act quickly by
        warming the person, replacing wet clothing, and getting them to shelter.
      </p>

      <p>
        To prevent hypothermia, dress in layers — start with a moisture-wicking base, add an insulating layer, and
        finish with a waterproof outer shell. Avoid cotton, as it retains moisture. Always pack extra dry clothing,
        food, and emergency gear, even on short outings. Preparedness and early response can make all the difference.
        Stay alert to the signs, know how to respond, and plan ahead to keep yourself and others safe in cold mountain
        conditions.

            The earliest signs include intense shivering, pale or cold skin, clumsiness, fatigue, and confusion. As the
            condition progresses, shivering may stop, speech may become slurred, and coordination decreases. If someone
            shows any of these signs, get them dry, warm, and sheltered immediately.

            Dress in layers: a moisture-wicking base layer, an insulating mid-layer, and a windproof, waterproof outer
            shell. Avoid cotton. Bring extra dry clothing, high-energy snacks, and an emergency thermal blanket or bivvy
            sack in your pack. Staying fueled and hydrated also helps your body generate heat.

          <p class="p2">
            Yes — especially if you’re wet from snow or sweat, and exposed to wind. Wind chill and moisture rapidly
            increase heat loss. Hypothermia can develop in temperatures as high as 10°C (50°F) under the right
            conditions, so always prepare for the worst.
